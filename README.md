# Neural Network Playgroud
I use this repository to study different neural network structures and the math behind them.  
This repository is organized by programming language and dataset the code is modeling. 

## Datasets
* MNIST - handwritten digit classification
    * Python/scratch_two_layer.ipynb
        * a jupyter notebook that studies the math of a simple two layer neural network applied to the mnist dataset. This neural network is programmed from scratch without using tensorflow or PyTorch.
    * R/scratch_conv.rmd
        * an rmarkdown notebook of a simple convolutional neural network written from scratch applied to the mnist dataset.
