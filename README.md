# Neural Network Playgroud
I use this repository to study different neural network structures and the math behind them.  
This repository is organized by programming language.

## Datasets
* MNIST
    * src/python/scratch_two_layer.ipynb
    * src/R/scratch_conv.rmd

## Notebooks
* src/python/scratch_two_layer.ipynb
    * a jupyter notebook that studies the math of a simple two layer neural network applied to the mnist dataset. This neural network is programmed from scratch without using tensorflow or PyTorch.
* src/R/scratch_conv.rmd
    * a rmarkdown notebook of a simple convolutional neural network written from scratch applied to the mnist dataset.
